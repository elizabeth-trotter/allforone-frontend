# All For One

**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Scope:** This is a `comprehensive project` that consolidates former mini API endpoints challenges into a 10-page web application. The focus of this project is to `build out the front end` using `Tailwind CSS` to create a `user-friendly interface` for each API endpoint. This project was based on a `mobile first design` and responsiveness was added for larger screen sizes. This was the first project in which I built a fully functional `Web API`, deployed on `Azure`, that can be accessed by other applications over HTTP.

### Peer Review

> The website works and calls all of the APIs correectly and displays an error if the inputted value isn't correct each page comes up correctly as well, and going in order. The only corrections that need to be made is the responsiveness for the mobile versions of every page but the Home one, and then the mad lib has all of the input feilds next to each other, all easy fixes that I was notified to before peer reviewing. Good work

**Issues Resolved:**
- Responsiveness added for all mobile pages :white_check_mark: *1/26/24 5:15 pm*
